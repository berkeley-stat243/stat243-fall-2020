\begin_layout Title
Stat243: Final group project
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Due Wednesday Dec.
 16, 5 pm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project will be done in groups of three, with students assigned randomly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few comments.
 First, the project, when split amongst the group members, is not intended
 to be a huge undertaking.
 The goals of the project are to give you experience in working collaboratively
 and developing a well-designed, well-tested piece of software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project will be graded as a letter grade and will count for about as
 much as two problem sets in your final grade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your task is to implement an adaptive-rejection sampler, described in the
 Unit 10 notes (Section 5.5) and with details in Section 2.2 of Gilks et al.
 (1992) - the PDF is in the 
\emph on
Files
\emph default
 area of bCourses.
 The result should be an R package that I can install and use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your solution should allow the user to provide reasonable inputs, including
 the number of points to sample, and should check the inputs for validity
 (e.g., using 
\emph on
assertthat
\emph default
).
 The primary input should be an R function that calculates the (possibly
 unnormalized) density of the distribution of interest in a vectorized fashion
 (e.g., many of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

d
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functions in R, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dnorm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are legitimate inputs).
 Your code should include numerical checks that catch cases of non-log-concave
 densities as the calculations proceed.
 (I.e., you do not need to come up with an overall test of the input density,
 but you should be able to do some checks that will catch cases where the
 upper and lower bounds are not actually bounding the density.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Formal testing is required with a set of tests where results are compared
 to some known truth.
 You should have tests for the overall function and any modules that do
 anything complicated.
 Given the output is stochastic, how to do this will require some thought.
 The output of your testing should be clear and interpretable.
 I.e., when I run your tests I should see informative messages of what is
 being done and whether a given test was passed or failed.
 You should also have unit tests for individual functions that carry out
 the individual computations that make up the algorithm.
 Please use the 
\emph on
testthat
\emph default
 package to set up your tests.
 Note also that an important part of the grade will depend on how your code
 performs on tests that I have prepared, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your solution should involve modular code, with functions or OOP methods
 that implement discrete tasks.
 You should have an overall design and style that is consistent across the
 components, in terms of functions vs.
 OOP methods, naming of objects, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In terms of efficiency, the algorithm is inherently sequential.
 However, you should try to vectorize as much as possible.
 One possibility in terms of the overall calculation is that you could generate
 a vector of samples based on the upper envelope.
 Then determine where are the points that require evaluation of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 All points up to the first of those points can be generated before changing
 the envelope, at which point you would throw away the remaining points.
 How many points you generate at once might vary depending on how far along
 you are in generating the number of points requested by the user.
 Or you may think of other tricks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Your solution should include help/manual information as follows: 
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Basic doc strings for any function you create (i.e., include comments at the
 beginning of the function), as well as commenting of code as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An overall help page for the primary function only.
 This help page should be directly in the form of standard R documentation
 in a file called
\emph on
 ars.Rd
\emph default
.
 You can either write 
\emph on
ars.Rd
\emph default
 by hand or you can have it generated based on using the 
\emph on
roxygen2
\emph default
 package (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Documenting-functions.html"

\end_inset

 for an example); in the latter case you would have the documentation included
 in the R code files.
 You do not need help pages for your auxiliary functions.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section*
Formatting requirements and additional information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your solution to the problem should have two parts: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A PDF document describing your solution, prepared in \SpecialChar LaTeX
 or R Markdown.
 The description does not need to be more than a few pages, but should describe
 the approach you took in terms of functions/modularity/object-oriented
 programming, and the testing that you carried out.
 It must include a paragraph describing the specific contributions of each
 team member and which person/people were responsible for each component
 of the work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An R package named 
\emph on
ars
\emph default
, including the .tar.gz file created by 
\family typewriter
R CMD build ars
\family default
, committed to the relevant GitHub repository (see below).
 The package should include:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A primary function called 
\emph on
ars
\emph default
 that carries out the simulation, located in a file 
\emph on
ars.R
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on
R
\emph default
 directory of the package,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Formal tests you applied to your overall function, located in the 
\emph on
tests
\emph default
 directory of the package.
 I will run the testing using 
\family typewriter
library(testthat); test_package('ars')
\family default
 (please check that you can run that successfully before submitting).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Auxiliary functions used by the primary function and testing function,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Help information for the main function, in a file 
\emph on
ars.Rd
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on
man
\emph default
 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
I should be able to install the package using 
\family typewriter
\series default
remotes::install_github('student_name/ars')
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For a given subtask of the problem, if you find good code available, you
 may use it as a modular component of your code provided it does not constitute
 too large a part of your solution and provided you test the code.
 Consult me with questions on this matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should use Git and GitHub to manage your collaboration.
 Please have the project be a repository within 
\emph on
github.berkeley.edu/stat243-fall-2020
\emph default
 or a repository within the 
\emph on
github.com
\emph default
 account of one of the project members.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should start the process by mapping out as a group the modular components
 you need to write and how they will fit together, as well as what the primary
 function will do.
 After one person writes a component, another person on the team should
 test it and, with the original coder, improve it.
 Or you might consider using pair programming over a Zoom session.

\begin_layout Standard
A good starting place for information about R packages is Hadley Wickham's
