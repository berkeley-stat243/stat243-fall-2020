## Software

The `howtos` directory has information on installing and/or getting access to the software you'll need for the course. In particular, in the second week of class you'll need to get access to the UNIX command line in some fashion. See https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2020/blob/master/howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md for some options on how to do this. 

## Submitting assignments

The file [submitting-electronically.txt](./howtos/submitting-electronically.txt) has information on setting up a Github repository for the class and submitting your assignments by committing your solution to Github. We will discuss this in section on Friday Sep. 4.

## Online discussion and questions.

We will use the [course Piazza site](https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2020/stat243) for communication (announcements, questions, and discussion). If you're enrolled in the class you should be a member of the group and be able to access it. If you're auditing or not yet enrolled and would like access, make sure to fill out the survey above and I will add you.
