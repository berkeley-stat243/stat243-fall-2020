I'm surprised they made the graphs the way they did.
 A few critiques:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1) missing y-axis scales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2) not obvious what the colors signify in the graphs broken down by sport
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3) Generally, it's a bad idea to jitter the baseline.
 Here, there curves move up and down (why?) so there's no zero from which
 to judge the height of the area.
 It's a better idea to make the curves flat against the x-axis.
 In ggplot, the command is geom_area and there's an example of what a better
 plot would look like here.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Have a high density of information to space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Show the data clearly: are the relationships and patterns that are clearly

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use varying symbol or line types 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use multiple panel plots 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid 3-d graphics unless they truly add information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid stacked barplots (see demo code) as it's hard to assess anything except
 the total and the baseline category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Studies indicate that humans have a hard time comparing areas, volumes,
 or angles, so try to avoid plots that represent data using any of these,
 including pie charts.
 Instead use position or length (horizontal is better than vertical) to
 display data values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Label axes and include units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Keep the ranges of axes (and other features) the same for multiple panels,
 when possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use a legend where appropriate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use vector graphics formats such as PDF or Postscript/EPS as these scale
 without pixelation when resized.
 Raster formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF don't rescale well and when
 they have high resolution also have large file sizes.

\begin_layout Section
Base R graphics (the 
\emph on
graphics
\emph default
 package)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The material here mainly gives high-level information and information on
 adjusting your graphics, rather than telling you how to make particular
 plots using R's base graphics.
 The 
\emph on
graphicsCommands.pdf
\emph default
 file in the github repository and Chapter 14 of Adler provide information
 about many of the core plotting functions.
 These include high-level functions such as 
\emph on
plot()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
matplot()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
pairs()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
coplot()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
hist()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
density()
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
boxplot()
\emph default
, as well as low-level functions for adding information to a plot such as
 
\emph on
lines()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
points()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
abline()
\emph default
.
 Adler goes into great detail on many of these, both in the context of the
 
\emph on
graphics
\emph default
 package and that of the 
\emph on
lattice
\emph default
 package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic components of R base graphics are 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
high-level functions (e.g., 
\emph on
plot()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
boxplot()
\emph default
, etc.) for producing an entire plot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
low-level functions for adding components to existing plots.
 The ability to build up a complicated plot piecewise is one of the strengths
 of R's graphics.
 These low-level functions include 
\emph on
abline()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
arrows()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
axis()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
legend()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
lines()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
points()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
rug()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
text()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
mtext(), title()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
symbols()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
graphics parameters controlled through (1) 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
 or (2) as arguments to a graphics function call.
 These parameters change the appearance of a plot or plots (e.g., 
\emph on
mai
\emph default
, 
\emph on
pch
\emph default
, 
\emph on
col
\emph default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R graphics work by sequentially plotting graphics elements, so subsequent
 items may paint over initial elements.
 One technique when this is an issue is making your colors transparent -
 see the color subsection below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that as we saw when talking about OOP, the core 
\emph on
plot()
\emph default
 function does both scatterplots and is a generic method used for plotting
 a wide variety of objects, e.g., 
\emph on
plot.lm()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I won't say much about the high-level and low-level functions, but a wide
 range of these exist.
 In particular low-level functions allow you to add almost anything you
 might want to add: arbitrary lines, polygons, symbols, text, arrows, boundary
 lines in maps, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graphics parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can set graphics parameters through various plotting functions (for temporary
 changes applying only to the current plotting command) or through the 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
 function (for a permanent change), allowing us to customize the layout
 or appearance of a plot.
 Let's take a look at some of these and what they mean.
 The demo code shows some additional more complete code examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of you know how to create a multi-panel plot:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Chunk
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
multi-panel, eval=FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing the margin sizes (and axis information spacing) is one of the most
 common modifications one needs to do, particularly when producing a multi-panel
 plot and when creating an output file.
 One often wants to reduce the size of the inner margins.
 This helps maximize the information to white space and increase the resolution
 of your plot.
 Sometimes one needs extra space in the outer margin of a multi-panel plot.
 Positioning and lengths within the graphics window can occur with relative
 units; i.e., the device domain is 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)\times(0,1)$
\end_inset

, or in physical units (commonly inches), or in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of text.
 Some values I commonly use are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Chunk
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
common-options, eval=FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here for the margins, the first number is the bottom, the next the left,
 the third the top, and the fourth the right margin, so with 
\emph on
omi
\emph default
, I've made some space (0.3 inches) in the outer margin at the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you change graphics options using 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
 (including within a function call!), the values change permanently (so
 it's like pass by reference).
 One way to be able to go back is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Chunk
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
oldpar, eval=FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if you create a function that changes the graphics parameters, you should
 use the above strategy to reset so you don't surprise your users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the various layout parameters and their units: 
\emph on
din
\emph default
 (device size, inches), 
\emph on
pin
\emph default
 (plot size, inches), 
\emph on
fin
\emph default
 (figure size, inches), 
\emph on
mai
\emph default
 (margin size, inches) or 
\emph on
mar
\emph default
 (margin size, lines), 
\emph on
omi
\emph default
 (outer margin, inches) or 
\emph on
oma
\emph default
 (outer margin, lines), 
\emph on
mex
\emph default
 (# text lines per interline spacing), and 
\emph on
plt
\emph default
 (plot region as fraction of figure region).
 
\emph on
cex
\emph default
 controls size of points and text in general when called through 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
, but only controls the size of points when called within a plotting function,
 while 
\emph on
cex.lab
\emph default
, 
\emph on
cex.axis
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
cex.main
\emph default
 control the size of axis labels, axis values, and the title.
 Similarly for 
\emph on
col
\emph default
, 
\emph on
col.lab
\emph default
, 
\emph on
col.axis
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
col.main
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some other things you can control: text justification (
\emph on
adj
\emph default
), font size (
\emph on
cex
\emph default
, 
\emph on
csi
\emph default
), font type (
\emph on
font
\emph default
), rotation of text (
\emph on
srt
\emph default
), color (
\emph on
col
\emph default
), line type (
\emph on
lty
\emph default
), line width (
\emph on
lwd
\emph default
), plotting character symbol (
\emph on
pch
\emph default
), type/presence of boundary box (
\emph on
bty
\emph default
), log-scale axes (
\emph on
log
\emph default
), axis labels (
\emph on
{x,y}lab
\emph default
), axis limits (
\emph on
{x,y}lim
\emph default
), a variety of details about the axis limits, labels, and ticks (
\emph on
lab
\emph default
, 
\emph on
las
\emph default
, 
\emph on
tck
\emph default
, 
\emph on
{x,y}axp
\emph default
, 
\emph on
{x,y}axs
\emph default
, 
\emph on
{x,y}axt
\emph default
), and whether to plot axes (
\emph on
axes
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Some additional tidbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can force subplots to have the same axis ranges by manipulating 
\emph on
xlim
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
ylim
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be handy to put axis labels in the outer margin of a multi-panel
 plot:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Chunk
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
xylim, eval=FALSE
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note if we wanted to put the label further towards the edge of the plot,
 we'd need to use 
\emph on
omi
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
oma
\emph default
 to create an outer margin, and then we could use a value of 
\emph on
line
\emph default
 that is greater than -1 to put the text further away from the plotting
 regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can create multi-line text by just using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on

\backslash
n
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in your character string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To plot outside the plot region, set 
\family typewriter
xpd = TRUE
\family default
 - otherwise anything outside the region is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clipped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding information to a plot sequentially
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are lots of low-level functions you can use to add components to a
 plot.
 These include 
\emph on
abline()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
arrows()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
axis()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
legend()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
lines()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
points()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
rug()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
text()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
mtext(), title()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
symbols()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
hline()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
vline()
\emph default
.
 A basic strategy for customizing components of a plot is to use the high-level
 function to plot the basics, specifying parameter arguments that leave
 out some components (e.g., 
\family typewriter
xaxt = 'n
\family default
', 
\family typewriter
bty = 'n
\family default
\series bold
', 
\family typewriter
\series default
xlab = 
\family default
\series bold
''
\series default
).
 At its most extreme, you can create the structure of a plot without plotting
 any data for customizing everything:

 This gives you control over positioning using the

 Here's an example of plotting two sets of data with different axis values.
 It also shows the use of the new argument to overplot on an existing plot.
 Often one would initially exclude (some) axes and a boundary box from the
 plot:

\begin_layout Standard
The

 in place of a string or plotmath syntax in plotting contexts.
 Note that you need to escape the usual backslashes in \SpecialChar LaTeX

 end up with double backslashes.
 And for math notation, you need the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 syntax within a math environment.

For plotting text, it's helpful to keep in mind that we can choose a display
 of text based on the encoding of the characters and a font in which to
 display the characters.
 So if you need characters not in the standard Latin character scheme, it
 should be doable by choosing a different encoding.

Plotting in three dimensions and mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general for plotting

\emph default
, either in an actual spatial setting or as a function of two variables,
 I prefer the 
\emph on
image()
\emph default
 function (
\emph on
levelplot()
\emph default
 in lattice), which uses color to represent different levels.
 
\emph on
image.plot()
\emph default
 from the fields package nicely adds a color bar legend.
 
\emph on
contour()
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
persp()
\emph default
 are other options but I personally find them less informative most of the
 time: 
\emph on
contour()
\emph default
 because it requires the viewer to read the contour line values and 
\emph on
persp()
\emph default
 because some of the features often hide other features.

If you do want to make a 3-d plot of a surface, 
\emph on
persp()
\emph default
 will do it, with x, y, z arguments similar to 
\emph on
image()
\emph default
 and also having arguments for the angle of view (the rotation around the
 z-axis –
\emph on
 theta
\emph default
) and the viewing angle (up or down – 
\emph on
phi
\emph default
).
 You may be able to choose a set of angles that show the surface with the
 least amount of hidden material.
 See the demo code for using 
\emph on
image()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
contour()
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
persp()
\emph default
 to show topography in a mapping context.

R has a lot of tools for mapping in a variety of packages – for more examples
 see the demo code.
 In particular you can import standard GIS shape files and overlay boundaries
 on a map using the

 R also has state and national boundaries as part of the

Lattice and ggplot2

Here we'll see some of the main kinds of graphs, contrasting the syntax

\emph on

\emph default
 and 
\emph on
ggplot2
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
lattice
\emph default
 package provides an alternative set of graphics functions based on the
 Trellis graphics system.
 
\emph on
ggplot2
\emph default
 is another popular alternative developed by Hadley Wickham.
 In both packages, the style is prescriptive, which in some cases is good
 (think 
\emph on
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\emph default
 vs.
 
\emph on
Microsoft Word
\emph default
).
 Both packages are well set up for dealing with conditioning either through
 sets of panels or through grouping by color or symbol.
 In the case of multi-panel plots, the style exploits the inter-relatedness
 of the information, with 'strips' giving labelling information, and avoidance
 of repetition of axis information.

Graphics devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphics are plotted on a 
\emph on
device
\emph default
.
 In the old days when computer monitors were not high resolution or in color,
 this referred to a physical device, but nowadays this is a general term
 that denotes the context in which the plot is being made: typically on
 screen or as a file in a particular file format.
 The standard device in a UNIX environment is X11, basically a graphics
 window set up in the X11 windowing system.
 On-screen plotting is generally done with R interacting with a window manager
 for the operating system, so R is not interacting directly with the physical
 display.
 Often one needs to iterate to get a plot to look good when printed to a
 file; in particular the aspect (width to height ratio) (e.g., you can specify
 width and height in 
\emph on
pdf()
\emph default
), the margin sizes relative to the size of the core plot, and size of plotting
 symbols and text relative to the size of the plot.
 That is the relative sizes when seen in a graphics window on the screen
 may be very different when printed to a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can have multiple graphics windows open at once; you'll need to explicitly
 call the function for opening a device to set up any additional ones.
 
\emph on
dev.cur()
\emph default
 tells the number of the active one and 
\emph on
dev.set()
\emph default
 allows to change it.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
pdf()
\emph default
 function is a workhorse for creating an output file containing your R graphics.
 Analogues of 
\emph on
pdf()
\emph default
 include 
\emph on
postscript()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
png()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
tiff()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
bmp()
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
jpeg()
\emph default
.
 If you have already made the plot in the graphics window and want to export
 it, you can use 
\emph on
dev.copy2pdf()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: Lattice graphics are optimized for the current plotting device, so
 using 
\emph on
dev.copy2pdf()
\emph default
 and the like is a bad idea since the graphic will have been optimized for
 the computer screen window.
 Instead use 
\emph on
pdf()
\emph default
 and the like to make the plot within the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Vectorized vs.
 rasterized file formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
pdf and postscript images are vectorized - in general elements of the image
 are symbolic objects (such as points, text, symbols, line segments, etc.)
 and when an image is resized, the items rescale appropriately for the new
 size without losing resolution.
 In contrast, with a rasterized format such as JPEG, individual pixels are
 plotted, and when an image is rescaled, in particular enlarged, one is
 stuck with the resolution that one used in plotting the figure (i.e., one
 has the original pixels but if you zoom, you only show some of them, losing
 resolution).
 One downside to vectorized images is that with a lot of points or line
 segments, they can be very large.
 For 2-d images such as created by
\emph on
 image()
\emph default
, rasterized formats do make some sense inherently, though the other features
 in the file (such as any text) is also rasterized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
File formats for journal articles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For inserting into Latex files for journal articles, I typically use 
\emph on
pdf()
\emph default
 in combination with 
\emph on
pdflatex
\emph default
 to compile the Latex file.
 In some cases for large images I will use 
\emph on
jpeg
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
png
\emph default
 files for figures in a paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Journals sometimes request either 
\emph on
postscript
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
encapsulated postscript
\emph default
 (EPS) format images.
 If you create a single R plot (as opposed to multiple pages), using 
\emph on
postscript()
\emph default
, the result should be EPS compatible.
 You can do this with the arguments 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE, paper = "special"
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

or by calling 
\emph on
setEPS()
\emph default
.
 If you have a postscript file that is not EPS, 
\emph on
ps2epsi
\emph default
 is a Ghostscript tool that can do the conversion from 
\emph on
ps
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
eps
\emph default
 (i.e., 
\emph on
epsi
\emph default
).
 EPS is a standardized form of postscript and contains a bounding box describing
 the bounds of the image.
 EPSI files contain a bitmapped preview image in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interchange
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format that systems can use to show an approximation of the image even
 if they can't render (i.e., display) postscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discussing much about postscript is beyond our scope, but note that postscript
 files are just text in a particular language that the printer uses for
 generating a printout.
 So you can use 
\emph on
less
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
emacs
\emph default
 to view the file in UNIX.
 You'll see that it says that it's EPS and has a bounding box.
 It's occasionally handy to search for and replace text in a postscript
 file manually rather than regenerating the file.
 For example I could search for '
\emph on
noise
\emph default
' in 
\emph on
example.eps
\emph default
 (created in the demo code) and replace with something else.
 I could also monkey with the positioning, which should involve the numbers
 just before the text string.
 You can also do this sort of thing in pdf files as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conversion utilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UNIX has a lot of utilities for converting between image formats.
 Windows and Mac also have GUI-style programs for doing this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In UNIX,
\emph on
 pdftops
\emph default
 will convert pdf to postscript and with the optional argument 
\emph on
-eps
\emph default
 to encapsulated postscript, while 
\emph on
ps2epsi
\emph default
 will create encapsulated postscript.
 
\emph on
gs
\emph default
 (Ghostscript) will do a lot of different manipulations of ps and pdf files,
 including converting to jpeg and other formats and merging and splitting
 pages of pdf files.
 Here are some examples of command-line calls from within a UNIX shell:

Colors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default colors can be seen with 
\emph on
palette()
\emph default
.
 Using 
\emph on
col=i
\emph default
 in a plot uses the ith element of the output of 
\emph on
palette()
\emph default
.
 You can change the palette:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
palette(c(
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 You can also use RGB levels, discussed next.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Colorspaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colors live in a 3-dimensional space that can be parameterized in several
 ways.
 One standard parameterization is RGB, which is a set of three numbers indicatin
g the intensity of red, green and blue.
 We can use RGB levels to specify colors in R.

\begin_layout Standard
Notice 
\emph on
rgb()
\emph default
 gives us back the color as a hexadecimal number (
\emph on
#RRGGBB
\emph default
), where each of 
\emph on
RR
\emph default
, 
\emph on
GG
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
BB
\emph default
 is 2-digit hexadecimal number (base 16) in the range 0 (00) to 255 (FF),
 so red is #FF0000.
 A string in this format can be used to specify colors and you'll run across
 this in R if you work with colors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

One possibility is {yellow-blue}, {red-green}, {brightness}.
 The angle of rotation in the {yellow-blue}, {red-green} 2-d space is the
 hue.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another parameterization is HSV: 
\emph on
hue
\emph default
, 
\emph on
saturation
\emph default
 (colorfulness metric), and 
\emph on
value
\emph default
 (brightness).
 Let's see the demo code to see how colors vary as we change HSV values
 using 
\emph on
rainbow()
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A parameterization that uses a more absolute measure of colorfulness than
 saturation is HCL (hue, chroma, luminance).
 In the example in the demo code, none of the colors stands out more than
 the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
colorspace
\emph default
 package provides tools for manipulating colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Color sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we're using color to illustrate a continuous range of values, we need
 a meaningful color sequence.
 To construct a continuous color set giving a sequence of colors you can
 use a variety of color schemes: 
\emph on
rainbow()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
heat.colors()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
terrain.colors()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
topo.colors()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
temp.colors()
\emph default
, and (in the 
\emph on
fields
\emph default
 package), 
\emph on
tim.colors()
\emph default
.
 I know Tim! He likes to fish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main thing to avoid is a sequence in which the colors do not appear
 to vary smoothly or in some cases may not even appear monotonic.
 Let's examine a variety of the sequences (see the demo code).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
temp.colors()
\emph default
 is a good blue to red 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diverging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 color scheme that emphasizes magnitudes around a central point, with two
 hues - one for each direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
RColorBrewer
\emph default
 package is good for choosing colors for unordered levels, sequential ordering,
 and two-way diverging color ordering and the 
\emph on
ColorBrewer
\emph default
 website provides recommendations.
 We'll see an example in the section on mapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overplotting of points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a sidenote, if you have a scatterplot with many points that will overplot
 each other (as well as creating a huge file), consider the 
\emph on
scatterSmooth()
\emph default
 function as well as the 
\emph on
hexbin
\emph default
 package.
 The former creates a two-d density plots with outlying individual points
 included, while the latter creates an empirical two-d density by binning
 into hexagonal areas.
 A third approach is to have your color be partly transparent, so that overplott
ing results in darker colors.
 Note that this may not work on all devices.
 We can specify transparency level as either the 4th number in 
\emph on
rgb()
\emph default
 on a scale of 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque - the default), or as a fourth
 hexadecimal number on the scale of 00 to FF (0 to 255); e.g., 
\emph on
#FF000080
\emph default
 would be half-transparent red, since 80 is one-half of FF in base 16.

\begin_layout Subsection
Colorblindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thing to be aware of is that 7-8% of men are color blind.
 As we see in the demo code, the standard result of this is to make it difficult
 to distinguish red and green, so one may want to avoid color schemes that
 have both of these in them.
 We can use 
\emph on
dichromat()
\emph default
 from the 
\emph on
dichromat
\emph default
 package to assess the effect of colorblindness on viewing of one's images;
 see more in the demo code file.
