## problem 1

theta <- function(x1,x2) atan2(x2, x1)/(2*pi)

helical <- function(x) {
  f1 <- 10*(x[3] - 10*theta(x[1],x[2]))
  f2 <- 10*(sqrt(x[1]^2 + x[2]^2) - 1)
  f3 <- x[3]
  return(f1^2 + f2^2 + f3^2)
}

## problem 2

set.seed(1)
n <- 100
beta0 <- 1
beta1 <- 2
sigma2 <- 6

x <- runif(n)
yComplete <- rnorm(n, beta0 + beta1*x, sqrt(sigma2))

## Parameters above were chosen such that signal in data is moderately strong.
## The estimate divided by std error is approximately 3.
mod <- lm(yComplete ~ x)
summary(mod)$coef

## For problem 2d, you'll need to simulate the censoring process.
