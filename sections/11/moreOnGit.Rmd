Section this week is focused on learning more advanced functionally of Git and 
GitHub. We will practice a number of the tools that are useful when collaborating
with others on a GitHub repository.  There is additional information about using 
Git for collaboration and various other features in the appendix at the end for 
those of you that are curious. 

In section we will split into groups of 2 (or 3 if necessary) to practice creating
branches and merging. 

## To Do in Section: Using Git For Collaboration

We will do this as a partner exercise to practice collaborating with git and 
fixing issues that may arise during collaboration.  

1) Create a new repo (just one of you, doesn't matter who)
2) Add your partner(s) as a collaborator.  This can be done by clicking the Settings
option in the upper right and then selecting Collaborators on the menu on the left.
3) Each person create a new branch (call them something different), add a file 
or two to your branch and practice
merging to the `master` branch.  You can do either merge on the command line or 
use a pull request.  See section **Managing Branches** below for the commands.  
Make sure to use `git pull` before pushing your merge to the remote repo if you
do it through the command line.  
4) Test what happens when your remote repository is ahead of your local 
repository, but you already staged new changes.
  * Have one partner push a new commit to the remote repo
  * Have the other partner try to add, commit, and push new changes without pulling
  the most recent update and see what happens.
  * Resolve the merge conflict.  You can do this by calling `git pull` and merging
  the repositories or by using `git reset --soft` as described in the **Reset** 
  section below.
5) Test what happens when a collaborator (or you on a different computer) edits 
the same file?

## Git Tracks Contents, Not Files

Many revision control systems provide an `add` command that tells the system to 
start tracking changes to a new file. Git's `add` command does something simpler 
and more powerful: `git add` is used both for new and newly modified files, and 
in both cases it takes a snapshot of the given files and stages that content in 
the index, ready for inclusion in the next commit.

## Manual Pages

You can get documentation for a command such as `git log --graph` with:

```{bash}
man git-log
```
or
```{bash}
git help log
```


## Viewing Project History
At any point you can view the history of your changes using:

```{bash}
git log
```

If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use

```{bash}
git log -p
```

Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step:

```{bash}
git log --stat --summary
```

For a prettier, more detailed graph (with several more options to look up):
```{bash}
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```


## Undoing a Mistake: checkout, reset, and revert
### Checkout
`git checkout` can be used to look at a previous commit.  It can also be used to 
move to a different branch, which we will look at in the next section. Here we 
can look at code from a previous commit with: 
```{bash}
git checkout HEAD~1 # moves back 1 commit
git checkout HEAD~2 # moves back 2 commits
git checkout <commit_hash> # move back to a specific commit
```

To find commit IDs you can use `git log` or `git reflog`.  You can also find 
commit IDs on GitHub.  

Once you have looked at the commit you can go back to the most recent update using
```{bash}
git checkout master # or replacing master with whatever branch you are on
```

### Revert 
`git revert` is used when you want to undo the changes made in a previous 
commit. It will undo a commit by creating a new commit.  Consider using 
`git revert HEAD~1`, this will remove the changes that were added in the 
previous commit.  

```{bash}
git revert HEAD~1 
git revert HEAD~2 
git revert <commit_hash> 
```

### Reset
If you added something that shouldn't be commited or you want to reset your repo
to what it looked like at a previous commit, then you need to use 
the `git reset` feature.  

```{bash}
man git-reset

# e.g.
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1 
```

Git reset moves the tip of your working tree back to the specified revision (here, 
we go back one revision). The `--soft` flag means that the changes in the 
files are presevered, so all that was done was to undo the commit. If you use the 
`--hard` flag, then all changes are reverted to the specified time. 

If you have done something more complex, like commiting and attempting to push a 
large file, the command below may be useful.

```{bash}
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch <PATH/TO/FILE>' HEAD
```

This deletes everything in the commit history.

## Managing Branches

A single Git repository can maintain multiple branches of development. To create 
a new branch named "experimental", use

```{bash}
git branch experimental
```

If you now run
```{bash}
git branch
```

The "experimental" branch is the one you just created, and the "master" branch 
is a default branch that was created for you automatically. The asterisk marks 
the branch you are currently on; type

```{bash}
git checkout experimental
```

to switch to the experimental branch. Now edit a file, commit the change, and 
switch back to the master branch:

```{bash}
git add file
git commit -m "editted file"
```

Alternatively, one can "stash" the changes using `git stash`.  This saves your 
changes for later, and then reverts the working tree to the last 
HEAD (whatever the last commit was). This allows you to keep working without the 
changes being applied to any files.  You can apply those changes later 
using `git stash pop`, which applies the changes and removes them from your 
stash. Or, if you wish to apply the changes to multiple 
branches, you can use `git stash apply`, which applies the changes but leaves them 
in your stash.  

Now, you can switch back to the master branch.
```{bash}
git checkout master
```

Check that the change you made is no longer visible, since it was made on the 
experimental branch and you're back on the master branch.

You can make a different change on the master branch and commit. At this point 
the two branches have diverged, with different changes made in each. To merge 
the changes made in experimental into master, run:

```{bash}
git merge experimental
```

If the changes don't conflict, then the merge was succesful and you can add,
commit and push to the remote repository. If there are conflicts, markers will 
be left in the problematic files showing the conflict;

```{bash}
git diff
```

will show this. Once you've edited the files to resolve the conflicts,

```{bash}
git commit -a
```

will commit the result of the merge. Finally,

At this point you could delete the experimental branch with

```{bash}
git branch -d experimental
```

This command ensures that the changes in the experimental branch are already in 
the current branch.

If you want to remove a branch without pulling the changes into the master branch, 
the `-D` flag deletes it without checking any of the changes.

This only removes the branch from your local machine.  To remove it from the 
remote repository, you use:  
```{bash}
git push -d origin experimental
```

## Pull-requests
When working in a collaborative environment, instead of merging directly into 
the master, it is better to create a pull-request.  This
[link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) has a good 
step-by-step explanation.  Pull requests tell repository maintainers the difference
between the master repository and an individual's branch.  It will then allow
maintainers to comment on the pull request and get bugs fixed before the branch is
merged to the master.  

Pull requests are common practice in software development in industry.

### Importing A Project

I __do not__ recommend this process for initiating a new project. These steps are simple, 
until you get to creating the remote repository. Then, just like in the intro tutorial, 
you have you setup a new repository on Github and link it to the local one.  It 
is easier to create the repo on Github, clone the empty repo locally, then put 
files in it as desired. 

Assume you have a tarball linReg.tar.gz with your initial work. You can place it
under Git revision control as follows.

```{bash}
tar xzf project.tar.gz
cd project
git init
```

Git will reply (something along the lines)
```{bash}
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
```

You've now initialized the working directory-you may notice a new directory created, 
named ".git".

Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of all files under the current 
directory (note the .), with git add:

```{bash}
git add .
```

This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which Git calls the *index*. 
You can permanently store the contents of the index in the repository with `git commit`:

```{bash}
git commit -m "add"
```

This will prompt you for a commit message. You've now stored the first version of 
your project in Git.

### Making Changes
If we make changes to files `file1`, `file2` and `file3` we can add them to be commited with `git add` as we have discussed before: 
```{bash, eval= FALSE}
git add file1 file2 file3
```

You are now ready to commit. You can see what is about to be committed using `git diff` 
with the `--cached` option:

```{bash}
git diff --cached
```

(Without --cached, git diff will show you any changes that you've made but not 
yet added to the index.) 

You can also get a brief summary of the situation with `git status`:

```{bash}
git status
```

Alternatively, instead of running `git add` before `git commit`, you can use:

```{bash}
git commit -a
```

which will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add them to 
the index, and commit, all in one step.

### Amending file to commit
What if, in the files you just commited, there was a file you forgot?  This 
situation is handled via git's `amend` option in git commit.  Say we have added and
committed `file1`

```{bash}
git add file1
git commit -m "adding file1"
```

But we realize we also meant to commit `file2`.  We can do that by ammending the 
original commit as follows:
```{bash}
git add file2
git commit --amend -m "adding second file"
```

This allows you to add more files to a commit and then update the message, while 
keeping your original message/commmited-files there.
